## About
This ansible playbook has been created by Stephen "TheCodeAssassin" Hoogendijk. It will configure everything that is required to setup your own mailserver. The only thing you need to configure for yourself is the mailboxes and the webmail. Rainloop will be installed as the webmail client but still requires configuration.

## Configuring webmail (rainloop)
Please refer to the official documentation of rainloop (http://www.rainloop.net/docs/configuration/) for instructions on how to configure it.

## Adding e-mail addresses
